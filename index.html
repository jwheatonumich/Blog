        <h2>First Website Complete</h2>
        <h3>April 28, 2020</h3>
        <section>
            <h4>Site Structure</h4>
            <p>I've completed the remainder of the HTML and CSS lessons on Free Code Camp. I've also finished my first project: a <a href="https://jwheatonumich.github.io/Cy-Twombly-Tribute/" target="_blank">tribute page to Cy Twombly</a>. Rather than keep posting my notes and projects in the blog, I'm going to create two pages linked in the nav to compile projects and notes.</p>
            <p> I'm also going to start improving the structure and style of the blog based on what I've learned. Early steps will include making the content scale based on screen size and incorporating a CSS-gridbox to organize the various sections on the page. The color scheme could use some help too!</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Making something to be proud of</h4>
          <p>I'm learning that creating even a basic website takes time. And even more time if I want it to look good. I've decided to do more than just fulfil each of the project requirements and to turn the projects into pieces that I would be proud to have in my portfolio, where possible. Even where the project probably won't turn into a portfolio piece (like the CFA Survey page) I am still going to try to create a professional and finished product that I can be proud of.</p>
          <p>One obstacle to making portfolio level projects is that I only get my own feedback. I'm trying to remedy this by posting the projects to the Free Code Camp forums and also getting my wife's feedback. I'm also going to look for additional ways to get constructive feedback. Maybe a larger online community (Reddit?), a web development community, or someone else who is similarly trying to learn and working together? I've also thought of looking for a mentor.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Gridboxes</h4>
          <p>One of my favorite CSS tricks I've learned through the course is the gridbox. I've always thought that HTML was just structured through a series of invisible tables, but it turns out that I can create a grid on the page and attach each section of content to points on it. Right now it takes me a lot of iterations to get the grid to work the way I want, so I'll need to find ways to get more practice. I think this site is a likely first candidate.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h4>Testing and External Tools</h4>
          <p>When I was testing my own webpage I thought it looked great on my phone and computer, but I read a comment about a different site that made me wonder how it would look on an extremely large screen. Using a site called <a href="http://responsivetesttool.com/" target="_blank">Responsive Test Tool</a> I realized that it looked pretty bad. I think I'll add another new section to this site for useful tools so I don't lose track of them.</p>

      <h2>One Small Step</h2>
      <h3>April 23, 2020</h3>
      <section>
          <h4>Over a month of lockdown</h4>

          <p>
            This virus has had me locked in my home for so long that I'm attempting to learn to develop websites so I don't go stir-crazy.
            <br>
            <br>
            A week ago I started the tutorials on <a href = "freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">Free Code Camp </a> and it is a lot more fulfilling than I remember from my most recent attempt (a week of sleep-away camp in middle school.)
            <br>
            <br>
            I was going to dig out yet another notebook to take notes, but since I'm already filling one with my attempt to study for the CFA level 1 exam this December I decided to try to take notes in HTML itself.
            <br>
            <br>
            Attempts at notes for the first 5 sections on Responsive Web Design are here:
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://jwheatonumich.github.io/html-notes/" target="_blank">HTML Notes</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://jwheatonumich.github.io/css-notes/" target="_blank">CSS Notes</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://jwheatonumich.github.io/visual-design-notes/" target="_blank">Visual Design Notes</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://jwheatonumich.github.io/Applied-Accessibility/" target="_blank">Accessibility</a></li>
              <li><a href=" https://jwheatonumich.github.io/Responsive-Web-Design/" target="_blank">Responsive Web Design</a></li>
            </ul>

            I've been storing the data on GitHub so I can access it on multiple computers. It's a nostalgic blast from back when I was a miserable consultant trying to learn data analysis through a Udemy course. Never finished that one... but at least I remember what a Git is! And they have this great new desktop app so I don't have to memorize a bunch of code just to properly save my file. And I can host the pages there as websites.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm going to try to document my progress here. If I don't lose interest too quickly I hope it could be a nice way to both apply what I learn to this site and also record what it was like learning.
        </p>

        <h4>Interesting things I want to learn</h4>
        <p>
          One of my favorite parts about learning something new is "looking ahead" at all of the cool things I'll be able to do after the next few topics.
          <br>
          <br>
            Right now I'm excited about:
          <ul>
            <li>Learning some basic JavaScript</li>
            <li>Creating a cool portfolio projects</li>
            <li>Learning what the heck Bootstrap is</li>
          </ul>
          Hopefully this is not the last time I post on this blog.
